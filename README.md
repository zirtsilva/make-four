# make-four
A simple Java game I developed during my free time, to improve and train my recently learned programming skills.

# //The idea
The game is a clone of the famous connect four board game: a two-player game, in which the players take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

I started this project when I had about one month of experience in programming. Didn't focus too much on it, as I was extremelly busy during that time, and only worked on it during free hours.
Graphics implemented with the simple graphics library, the first ever library I learned.
All images were created by me using pixteller.com.

The project isn't finished yet. It still has bugs, as after playing for 3 rounds or more there are some issues. Will fix them when I have the time for it. Also need to create a main menu.
