# make-four
Game I made during my free time while doing the Academia de Código bootcamp.
Used the simple-graphics library (by Academia de Código), as it was the very first java library I learned about. When I learned it, I started this game. It isn't finished yet, as I have issues after playing a few games in a row. Will resolve these issues when I have the time.
Everything was done by me, from coding to design. 
Used Intellij as my IDE.
Created all the images on pixteller.com.
